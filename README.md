## Alternative package

An alternative package is avaiable on the online collaboration platform [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/project/57daf1247c5f29b427eb1f6f),  along with an example on how to use it.
The contents of the ShareLaTeX-project is also included in this repository as a zip-file, but you should preferably grab it from ShareLaTeX, since it's more likely to include updates than the one shipped with this repository.
